            As a Web Developer, I often gather, define and interpret business requirements, to design, build, enhance, test, and deploy modern web applications. I use code to solve problems. Whether working independently or within a team setting, I am able to juggle multiple projects while managing quality, communication, and creativity. I am always available to chat with you about your next project or current one. So let's connect! I look forward to speaking with you.
